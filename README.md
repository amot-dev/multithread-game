I don't know quite where I'm going with this yet, but for now, this is an """infinite"""" open-world medieval-era (NOT fantasy) exploration game. The game is based on a 2D board of "tiles, which each contain... stuff. Different parts of the game will run on different threads, not out of necessity or even performance requirements, but rather to better familiarize myself with threads.

For a more detailed explanation of implemented and planned features, see the roadmap [here](https://github.com/asd1o1/multithread-game/issues/1).
